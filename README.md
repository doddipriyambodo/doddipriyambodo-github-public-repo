# Public Source Code Repository at GitHub maintained by Doddi Priyambodo
in this repo, there are some applications that will be saved in in here:(yes, I know... I am combining them into one project!) - so, if you want to clone... eat them all! :D
- AWS Gaming Day is using full-stack game sample using GameLift and AWS services. By leveraging Amazon GameLift and AWS services including DynamoDB, Lambda, SQS, S3, EC2, ElastiCache and API-Gateway. This is a simple board game called Gomoku, but technically and functionally identical to a real-time session-based online game.
inspired from: https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-gamelift-sample

PS:
- Some of the folder are applications from other open source repository, you can check their link to get the updated codes. I am creating this source separately, since I did a couple of changes on the codes to meet my custom requirements.
- I am using 4 Souce Code Repo as my daily use: GitHub. BitBucket, GitLab, and of course... AWS CodeCommit
- I am using GitLab for my personal development project (private & public) = https://gitlab.com/doddipriyambodo while maintaining GitHub for my old projects (private & public) and fork projects. 
- I am using Atlassian Sourcetree and Git commands as my client tools. Also using StackEdit for my note tool.
- Let's Go BUILD!
